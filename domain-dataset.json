This is an ongoing development and as they become available more GSPs will become part of this process, and values\nmay change over time. </p>\n<p class=\"MsoNormal\">The Import limit is provided for winter, summer and the access period. The Historical Maximum and Minimum Power Flow comes from UK Power Networks' own analysis of the power flow through that GSP in the previous year. </p>\n<p>The Asset Import Limit and Asset Export Limit is calculated based on the Supergrid transformer capacities available at the GSP, and are provided for indicative purposes only and may not reflect the actual capacity at the GSP. </p>\n<p>The Export and Import Capacity Utilisation is then calculated as a ratio of the maximum and minimum demand and the capacity at the GSP, which where possible is the technical limits and where not possible, the asset capacity. Combined with the\nprevious table it provides a thorough view of headroom at all GSPs.</p>\n\n<h2>Methodological Approach</h2>\n<p>Data is compiled from existing datashare between UK Power Networks and the National Energy System Operator.
